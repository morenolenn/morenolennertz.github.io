        <b>The context</b>
        <p>
          Did you know that people tend to isolate themselves more and more from the world<br /> and that loneliness
          is
          already seen as a social problem?<br />
          Thinking about this scenario, I and some entrepreneurial friends thought of a solution<br /> that connects
          people,
          offering company and experience according to their affinity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="text">
        <b>The product</b>
        <p>
          Just as the Uber driver offers a ride and an owner on Airbnb offers accommodation,<br /> anyone at Glad can
          offer
          some kind of experience and charge a fee for it.<br />
          It can be a guitar lesson, a tour guide through the city, a chess match in the square or <br />simply a
          company to
          sing in karaoke.<br />
          On the one hand, someone makes money from their skills and hobbies.<br />
          On the other hand, someone has a new experience, meets a new person and, who<br /> knows, builds a new
          friendship.<br /><br />

          The first versions of Glad can now be downloaded in Brazilian app stores and are<br /> gradually being
          migrated to
          the current design of this page.

        </p>
      </div>

      <p class='text-margin'>
        I talked to 30 people (US and Brazil) and there is resistance when it<br /> comes to renting friends.<br />
        Maybe because renting a friend is assuming that you are lonely and have<br /> no friends, even if that is not
        true.<br />
        But there is no problem in paying someone to perform some activity.<br /><br />

        We had already decided that the core of communication would be the<br /> rental of friends. But when I brought
        these
        findings to the Glad team,<br /> <b>we decided to remove the word “friends”</b>.
        <br /><br />
        We would no longer be an app for renting friends, but an app to connect<br /> people with common affinities and
        interests.

      <h3>Lessons and the<br /> ouctomes so far</h3>
      <p>
        We are still using the old design in the store to learn as much as possible from the<br /> mistakes and we are
        gradually migrating to the "final" version that I presented here.<br /><br />

        Among the main things we learned, the main thing was <b>not having tested it<br /> extensively</b> before
        launching
        and that would save us a lot of time to develop and redo<br /> solutions. We launched two apps - for regular
        users and
        for Pro (like Uber and Uber<br /> driver) - and this is causing a <b>lot of confusion among users</b> and
        generating
        <b>a
          huge<br />
          communication effort on our part.</b>
